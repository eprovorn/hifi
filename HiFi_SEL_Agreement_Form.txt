HiFi (SEL) User Agreement Form:

HiFi (SEL) is an open source code development project for solving systems of coupled non-linear PDEs

license.  The project has been supported, in part, by the U.S. Department of Energy.  Before having 
access to the code, you must agree to the conditions of the license that serve as additional protections 
for the HiFi (SEL) code.
