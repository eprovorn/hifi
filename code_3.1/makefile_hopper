# This is the makefile for SEL on Hopper.
# Before compiling SEL, load the necessary modules with 
# the following commands:
#
# module load cray-petsc/3.4.2.0
# module load netcdf-hdf5parallel
#
# Then, export PHYSICS environment variable 
# to be the name of the [physics_templ].f application file you 
# would like to compile with the following command:
#
# export PHYSICS=physics_templ
#
# where "physics_templ" should be replaced with the name of
# your physics application file.
